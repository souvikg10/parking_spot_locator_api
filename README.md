## Parking API 

The goal of this project to demostrate certain REST API endpoint with a Swagger definition to connect to Firebase Realtime Database to update volunteered parking location of a currently parked car that is about to leave. This will then trigger an update in the database for others to use the location of the spot and park their own car in a given time and space frame.

Users can also give their own preferences to retrieve the right spots.
